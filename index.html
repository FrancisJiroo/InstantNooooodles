			<p>- <b>Momofuku Ando</b> walked through the streets of Osaka after the end of World War 2 and saw a long line of people in the cold waiting for a hot bowl of ramen. Due to the war, food shortages were common. This issue, alongside what he witnessed, made him want to come up with a cheap, easy-to-prepare ramen dish.

			<p>- Soon after, he invented <b>instant ramen</b> in <b>1958.</b></p>
			<p>- In a shed behind his house in <b>Ikeda, Japan</b>, Ando experimented with different ways of making, drying, and flavoring noodles. Through perseverance and trial and error, he had come up with a method of preparing noodles by sprinkling them with chicken soup and then frying them.

			<p>- In <b>1971, Ando</b> invented <b>Cup Noodles</b>, the world's first ramen to be served in a cup. The use of a cup was inspired by his travels in the US, where he observed that bowls weren't commonly used for instant noodles unlike in Asia.

			<p>- <b>Nissin</b>;, Ando’s company, continues to sell his product as Top Ramen and Cup Noodles in a wide range of flavors, including <b>beef, shrimp, and soy sauce.</b> The <b>Cup Noodles Museum</b>, with locations in <b>Ōsaka and Yokohama, Japan,</b> celebrates not only noodles but perseverance and ingenuity.

			<p>The production of instant noodles starts with the creation of the dough. Wheat flour, water, and salt are mixed together to create the noodle texture in the final product. The dough then moves on to the cutter or the noodle making machine. It cuts up the dough into strips. <br><br>

After being cut, they are cooked. Instead of being boiled, they are steamed, keeping the noodles' natural flavor as a result. It preserves the quality and taste of the noodles and makes it convenient. <br><br>

After the steaming process, they need to be dried to decrease their moisture content. Moisture prevents the noodles from being stored for longer and removes the crispier texture when eaten. The noodles are dipped in hot oil and taken out for a short period of time, bringing down the moisture. The heat from the oil also makes the noodles absorb water faster later on.<br><br>

Being cooked on the fryer made the noodles hot, and they cannot be packaged without being cooled to a safe temperature. After the fryer, they are cooled in a cooling tunnel where slightly chilled air is around them until they are the right temperature.<br><br>

After cooling, they are packaged up. To ensure freshness, they remove as much air as possible that comes in by vacuum sealing. They also control the moisture which further increases their shelf life.<br><br>
